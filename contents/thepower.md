## Editor's note

I have recently come to love two podcasts: [Overdue](https://overduepodcast.com/) and [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/). Both of these podcasts celebrate reading and sharing what we gather from reading. If you have not had a chance to check out either of those podcasts, I would highly recommend them. This entry in the sketchbook is a part of a series I have decided to call The Library Card. In this series, I am going to follow the leads of both Overdue and Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, sharing my thoughts while playing around with the ideas of the books that I am reading.

## Letter to the Editor

#### Thirty Second Recap - Blind Contour

Neil Armon writes a letter to the editor of a publishing about a book he has just finished, a
hybrid of history and narrative about how the power first came to. This is a world where women
hold power, a world where no one remembers that men were once soldiers, police officers, and 
positions of power. The editor of the publishing house reviewing his manuscript, Naomi, taunts 
Neil about mentioning a history where men might have had power, calling him a 'saucy boy' for do so.
Naomi, in her reply to Neil, goes on to say that she looks forward to reading through his manuscript,
that it will be a welcome distraction from her own book. She is intrigued by this alternative view of 
history in a "world run by men". She imagines that it would be a kinder, gentler, and -dare she say- a 
sexier world than the one in which they live. Looks like there are going to be plenty of cringe moments 
through the book, where the shoe is on the other foot.

### Blind Contour Recap

Neil Armon opens his historical novel, The Power, with an except from the Book of Eve. In this text the
'shape of power' is always the same: the branching of a tree, the strike of lightning, the path of rivers
flowing to the ocean, the central nervous system, and the branching of social networks and communities. 
This power is mirrored in all aspects of our lives. 

It looks lke this illustration of power lays the foundation for how natural the power dynamics of this world
is structured. This is the mythos of this world.

## Chapter I

### Thirty Second Recap - Blind Contour

Roxy is home with her mom when three men barge in. She does not know them, but they mean trouble. They didn't 
realize that she would be there and quickly stuff her in the cupboard beneath the stairs. She can hear her mom,
panicked, pleading with the men. Roxy, having been locked in the cupboard by her parents before, knows that she
can get out. Panickiing herself, she works at the lock with her fingernails. When she frees herself, she launches 
toward her mom and the men. One grabs her. She has been in fights before, but not like this. She can feel something 
within her building, a sense of power. She focuses it, and 'cups the lighting in her hand'. She grabs the man back, 
and she can smeel the scent of rain, and of burnt hair. The man's hand falls deaad by his side, but Roxy and her mom 
are not out of trouble yet. One of the men draws a knife and Roxy wills the power to return, but she it does not 
return in time. The next thing she feels is a swift blow to the nape of her neck.

Roxy wakes up dazed. The carpet is sodden with a dark red, and her hands are sticky. On the couch, her mom is unmoving with a handwritten note laid on her chest. It has a primrose on it.

Roxy is one of the first.
