  <h1>Preface</h1>

<p></p>

<p>
This is a section of the sketchbook where I write about the books that I am reading. 
The pieces here will be a collection of blind contour recaps, notes, references, and 
whatever else comes up. Much of this will be inspired by two of my current favorite
podcasts,  <a href="https://overduepodcast.com/">Overdue</a> and 
<a href="https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/">Harry Potter and the Sacred Text</a>. 
If you have not had a chance to check out either of those podcasts, I suggest you stop 
what you are doing right now, and check them out.

Here are the rules:

<p>
<h2>Blind Contour Recaps</h2>

Write fast, don't look up. This section is a quick recap of the text, and I am not allowed 
to look at what I have written. And the delete key is off limits. There is no strict time 
limit here, but as soon as I pause longer than a moment, that's it. Pen down. This bit will 
likely look I am drunk. Some people call this Hemingway mode.
