## Editor's note

I have recently come to love two podcasts: [Overdue](https://overduepodcast.com/) and [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/). Both of these podcasts celebrate reading and sharing what we gather from reading. If you have not had a chance to check out either of those podcasts, I would highly recommend them. This entry in the sketchbook is a part of a series I have decided to call The Library Card. In this series, I am going to follow the leads of both Overdue and Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, sharing my thoughts while playing around with the ideas of the books that I am reading.
