## Editor's note

I have recently come to love two podcasts: [Overdue](https://overduepodcast.com/) and [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/). Both of these podcasts celebrate reading and sharing what we gather from reading. If you have not had a chance to check out either of those podcasts, I would highly recommend them. This entry in the sketchbook is a part of a series I have decided to call The Library Card. In this series, I am going to follow the leads of both Overdue and Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, sharing my thoughts while playing around with the ideas of the books that I am reading.

### Thirty Second Recap - Blind Contour

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
