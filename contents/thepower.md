## Editor's note

I have recently come to love two podcasts: [Overdue](https://overduepodcast.com/) and [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/). Both of these podcasts celebrate reading and sharing what we gather from reading. If you have not had a chance to check out either of those podcasts, I would highly recommend them. This entry in the sketchbook is a part of a series I have decided to call The Library Card. In this series, I am going to follow the leads of both Overdue and Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, sharing my thoughts while playing around with the ideas of the books that I am reading.

## Letter to the Editor

#### Thirty Second Recap - Blind Contour

Neil Armon writes a letter to the editor of a publishing about a book he has just finished, a
hybrid of history and narrative about how the power first came to. This is a world where women
hold power, a world where no one remembers that men were once soldiers, police officers, and 
positions of power. The editor of the publishing house reviewing his manuscript, Naomi, taunts 
Neil about mentioning a history where men might have had power, calling him a 'saucy boy' for do so.
Naomi, in her reply to Neil, goes on to say that she looks forward to reading through his manuscript,
that it will be a welcome distraction from her own book. She is intrigued by this alternative view of 
history in a "world run by men". She imagines that it would be a kinder, gentler, and -dare she say- a 
sexier world than the one in which they live. Looks like there are going to be plenty of cringe moments 
through the book, where the shoe is on the other foot.
