  <h1>hi.</h1>

<p></p>

<p>
  This is a sketchbook of scribbled thoughts and notes, a place where I can put down some thoughts without 
  worrying too much about formatting, cohesiveness, or polish. I hear that in order to become a better writer,
  there are two very important things: reading lots of material and writing. Writing with abandon. The type of
  writing that strikes fear in the hearts of all those constant editors like me. So this is a place where I will 
  write and I will not look back up, at least until I feel that I have put my thoughts down. I will consider this
  the blind countour drawings of my writing. Who knows what shape it will finally take when I am done. 
  
  If you would like to see some more polished (read 'edited') writing, check out this site's companion,
