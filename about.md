There is not much to this sketchbook just yet, and I am not sure what topics 
will be covered here. I can guarantee that much of this writing will be rough.
Who knows how many incomplete sentences, run ons, and grammatical errors will 
show up. But that is part of the fun. Let's run with this idea and see what happens.

## Writer's note

Who knows why I might choose to keep my sketchbook open for all of the world to 
see. Maybe it's because it is safe to say that almost no one will find this. There is 
some freedom in knowing that search engines will most likely never queue this up to the top
of the lists. And, for all you know, my really embarrassing writing is tucked away in
some notebook somewhere.
