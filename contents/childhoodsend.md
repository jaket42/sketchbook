## Editor's note

I have recently come to love two podcasts: [Overdue](https://overduepodcast.com/) and [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/). Both of these podcasts celebrate reading and sharing what we gather from reading. If you have not had a chance to check out either of those podcasts, I would highly recommend them. This entry in the sketchbook is a part of a series I have decided to call The Library Card. In this series, I am going to follow the leads of both Overdue and Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, sharing my thoughts while playing around with the ideas of the books that I am reading.

I believe I have the most recent printing of Arthur C. Clarkes, Childhood's End. While the original version places 
itself in the context of 1953, where men had not yet traveled outside of Earth's atmosphere, this copy reimagines the setting to be where men have traveled to the moon and are now preparing to go to Mars. At the beginning of the text there is a note: "Note: Apart from the new Prologue, o alterations have been make to the text. From Chapter Two onwards, Childhood's End remains exactly as in 1953." I am not sure if the 'new Prologue' is chapter one. It must be.
If not, I will not make any claim as to the originality of the beginning of this book. Whatever.

## Chapter I

### Blind Contour Recap

'Helena Lyakhov always went through the same ritual. She was not the only cosmonaut who did so,
though few ever talked about it.' We are introduced to Helena, a Russian cosmonaut who is preparing
for a new, internationally coordinated mission to Mars. She is reflective, thinking of an old Cold War
cosmonaut, Yuri, as a busload of tourists show up. She prepares herself for the tourists' cameras when 
she notices that they are not pointed towards her, but up to the sky. Turning, she catches just a glimpse 
of the 'gigantic shadow sliding behind the moon.' 

The mission commander, Mohan Kaleer, saw the ship from the edge of a volcanic crater used to prepare the 
astronauts for Olympus Mons. At once he realized that the history of humanity was at an inflection point. 
It was like watching an ice shelf break from a glacier and fall to the sea. The ship was beautiful. It far
outstretched any accomplishment that human kind had ever achieved. And yet, he had no regrets in his life's 
work. Still, all this time he had spent to reach the stars, and now the stars have come to him.

## Chapter II

### Blind Contour Recap

Chapter two opens in the Secretary-General of the United Nations' office some years after the arrival of 
the ships. Rikki Stormgren is looking down on the streets below, anticipating the arrival of Alexander Wainwright, a
figurehead for an international group that resists the intervention of earth's new Overlords. It is a meeting
he is not looking forward to. For the past few years, Rikki has stood as Earth's ambassador to the Overlords. 
Only he has ever stepped foot on one of their ships, and even he has never seen an Overlord face-to-face. The 
Overlords have never once been hostile, despite at least one nation attacking an Overlord ship with a nuclear missle.
On the contrary, the Overlords have only been helpful for humanity. There is no longer famine or poverty, and the
living wage for all people has been steadily rising since the Overlords' arrival. This does not alleviate the fear
of group's like Wainwright's Freedom League, who feel that humanity's God given Liberty is stripped away by the 
control of the Overlords. 

Rikki agrees to make mention the objections of the Freedom League to the Overlords' ambassador, Karellen. When Rikki
and Karellen meet in the Overlords' ship, their conversation is genial. Rikki asks if the Overlords will show 
themselves to the world, to alleviate some of the tension. Karellen notes that, all things considered, humanity has
been trusting of the Overlords, but that there still seems to be resistance that stems from the world's religions. "Not all religions can be right" says Karellen, and he seems hesitant to broach that subject much further. Karellen
promises Rikki that he will talk with his superiors to see if there might be a way to alleviate some of the fears that groups like the Freedom League harbor. 

### Notes

It is interesting that the Overlords do not deal with individual nations. Instead, they work only directly with 
the United Nations. I like the idea that the Overlords seem not to have a preference for a particular type of governance. This seems to imply that they recognize there are many ways that people can live, and that peace/prosperity can coexist with diversity. 

The Overlords seem want the betterment of humanity, even if they do not reveal their motivations. It is interesting 
that they do not show themselves in public, and it isn't clear just how many Overlords are in the ships.
